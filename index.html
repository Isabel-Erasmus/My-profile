		         I’m a business administration student with a strong creative drive and an eye for design and storytelling. I’m fascinated by how businesses can connect with people on a deeper level—through thoughtful branding, immersive experiences, and emotional impact. Inspired by projects like neo ūnit, I believe that creativity isn’t just an add-on, but a powerful tool to shape how we see, feel, and interact with the world around us.

	           <p>
		          I’m a third-year International Business student majoring in Finance and Control at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. I’m passionate about combining financial insight with creative vision—using both numbers and storytelling to shape meaningful brand experiences. I see business not just as a system of profit and control, but as a space where design, emotion, and strategy come together. Through my work, I aim to help companies make smart decisions that are both financially solid and creatively bold.

		          I blend business strategy with creative thinking to build ideas that are both smart and emotionally impactful. With a background in Finance and Control, I think in systems—but I’m also guided by instinct and inspired by design. Whether it’s shaping a brand or solving a complex challenge, I aim to create work that feels sharp, expressive, and human.
